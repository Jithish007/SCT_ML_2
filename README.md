# Task 02 – K-Means Customer Segmentation

This project performs customer segmentation using the Mall Customers Dataset.  
The goal is to group customers based on their Annual Income and  
Spending Score using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## 📌 Workflow
- Load the dataset (Mall_Customers.csv)
- Select key features for clustering
- Use Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters
- Apply K-Means with K = 5
- Visualize clusters and centroids
- Save results to clustered_customers.csv

## 📊 Visualizations
1. Elbow Method Graph  
2. Customer Segments (Scatter Plot)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Files Included
- task2_kmeans_clustering.py
- Mall_Customers.csv
- clustered_customers.csv
